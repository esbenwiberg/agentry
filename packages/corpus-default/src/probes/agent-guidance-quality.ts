  rationale: `
    Length is a crude proxy for guidance quality (see agent.guidance-substance).
    A 200-line CLAUDE.md full of generic platitudes is worse than a 30-line
    one that names the actual build command. This probe asks an LLM to judge
    the guidance file against four criteria: specificity, actionability,
    coverage of build/test/run/architecture, and project-fit. The result is
    cached so a clean run is free; only changes to guidance content (or the
    probe version) re-incur a model call.
  `,

  remediation:
    "Make your CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md specific to THIS project: real paths, real commands, real conventions. Cover build, test, run, and where the major code lives. Generic platitudes ('write clean code') score poorly; concrete project-specific instructions score well. Tip: include the exact commands an agent should run for typecheck, test, lint, and dev server.",
