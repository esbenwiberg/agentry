# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR captures one decision: the context, the options, what was chosen, and
why. Format follows [Nygard's
template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADRs are numbered, immutable once accepted, and superseded by writing a new one
that points back. Don't edit history — explain how it changed.

## When to write an ADR

Write one when a decision will affect future contributors and the "why" isn't
self-evident from the code. Skip ADRs for tactical choices, naming bikesheds,
and anything that gets re-litigated weekly.

A useful test: "if someone tries to undo this in six months, what would I want
them to read first?" — if the answer is a comment, write a comment. If the
answer is a paragraph with tradeoffs, write an ADR.
